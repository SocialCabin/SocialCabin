# Ask-Questions

**Welcome to our GitHub ask questions repo!**

Here you can ask questions related to the project wether it be code based or just a general F&Q!


# What Can I Ask?
Anything! You can just pop in and say hi, ask what progress we've made and more. But if you want support it's better to email us at contact@socialcabin.co.uk

# Moderation?
The discussions will be moderated by me and a few of my team members. If you post anything innapropriate or NSFW or NSFL you will be blocked from the repo.

# Help! I need to report something to the moderation team

# Can I appeal a ban or a block from the discussions?
Yes! You can just send us an appeal at contact@socialcabin.co.uk and title it _GitHub discussions appeal_.

# Anything else?
Nope apart from Do Not spam ping staff, be sensible and if you have a concern you can use the report channel or contact us under contact@socialcabin.co.uk.
